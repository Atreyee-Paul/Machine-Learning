# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects by Atreyee Paul

Welcome to my Machine Learning project repository! This collection showcases five end-to-end ML projects I've built using real-world datasets, exploring both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Each project focuses on solving practical problems using Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and more.
