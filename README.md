# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects by Atreyee Paul

Welcome to my Machine Learning project repository! This collection showcases six end-to-end ML projects I've built using real-world datasets, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Each project solves practical problems using Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and other essential tools.
